Simple WebRTC Video Meeting 
---------------------------
(using PubNub as signal server)

I could say I complete 60% implementation with this web app. The goal of this project to replace Cisco WebMeeting 
or Google+ Hangout with something 100% open-source! 

Right now it can only send email invitation for an online video chat (work both on Desktop & Mobile platform) 
... next feature for screensharing, etc ...
